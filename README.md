# Incognito Record

A generic blog. It will mostly contain information that I find useful; but on a rare occasion,
I might sneak in a few opinionated posts on random issues.

## Getting started

Pull this repository and do a `yarn && yarn start` and you are good to go :).

Install ESLint in VSCode marketplace. I have not tested this on other IDE like Atom or IntelliJ.

Here are a list of commands:

`yarn start`: Run a local development server

`yarn build`: Build a production ready bundle files to be served on AWS S3

`yarn test`: Run test

## Deployment

TODO

## Known Issues

* prettier does not automatically fix comments that are larger than max-length

## Why is this blog called Incognito Record

I choose incognito because why not, but I prefer a different
name than "incognito blog"; so I googled synonyms for "blog", and "record" shows up.

## I want to contribute, what should I know before I get started?

Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` (CONTRIBUTING.md)
