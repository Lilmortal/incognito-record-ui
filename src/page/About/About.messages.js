    Hey all, my name is Jack. This website is made from scratch by me to showcase my progression towards being a competent full stack developer. I will be showcasing what I have learnt so far, as well as detailing what do I still need to improve on. 
    
    The code for this website is found in this github link: {link}. At the moment, it has most of the foundations for i18n, a11y, which I am planning to resolve in the coming weeks.`

    Gain a thorough understanding of software development in general; at the moment, focusing particularly on the web. This includes system design which I am heavily focusing on at the moment; and performances, particularly Big O notations (time and space complexity). On the web, front end, back end, deployment, and some database skills. I have wrote down a list of concepts in my own room that I started few years ago, I am intending to finish it.
    
    The first to get it out of the way is I do not have much experiences in any of the cloud features, e.g. AWS. I have basic experiences in AWS S3, Cloudfront, Route 53, EC2, DynamoDB, and RDS. The more advanced topics I can catch up on in my 9-5 work.

    I still lack basic understanding of networking in general, (e.g. subnets etc). AWS VPC, VPN etc; as well as Cloudformation or Terraform.`

    I will be posting what I have learnt, and what project I am currently doing that will help support this. Large companies typically conduct interviews where you are expected to think out loud.
      
    I will be posting my solutions to coding questions and how I reach that conclusion. This will be beneficial for me for the upcoming decades as I will forget stuff, but reading this posts will help me remember it. Coding questions will typically come from Cracking the Coding Interview book and https://www.dailycodingproblem.com`
