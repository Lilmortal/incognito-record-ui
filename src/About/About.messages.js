    Hey all, my name is Jack. This website is made from scratch by me to kinda practice and be a personal blog for me to input what I have learnt. 
    
    The code for this website is found in this github link: {link}. At the moment, it has most of the foundations for i18n, a11y, which I am planning to resolve in the coming weeks.`,

    There are still some basic concepts that I do not yet fully understand. When I learn something, I tend to forget it after a few months. So I'm going to put what I have learn here.`,

    Gain a thorough understanding of software development in general; at the moment, focusing particularly on the web. This includes system design which I am heavily focusing on at the moment; and performances, particularly Big O notations (time and space complexity). Also a thorough understanding of the web, (front end, back end, deployment, and some database skills). I have wrote down a list of concepts in my own room that I started few years ago, I am intending to finish it.
    
    The first thing to get it out of the way is I do not have much experiences in any of the cloud features, e.g. AWS. I have basic experiences in AWS S3, Cloudfront, Route 53, EC2, and RDS. The more advanced topics I will put what I have learn here. In the coming weeks, I will be writing about CNames, Alias records, EBS as well as EFS.

    I still lack basic understanding of networking in general, (e.g. subnets etc). AWS VPC, VPN etc; as well as Cloudformation or Terraform.`,

    I will be posting what I have learnt, and what project I am currently doing that will help support this.
      
    I will be posting my solutions to coding questions and how I reach that conclusion. This will be beneficial for me for the upcoming decades as I will forget stuff, but reading this posts will help me remember it. Coding questions will typically come from Cracking the Coding Interview book and https://www.dailycodingproblem.com`,
